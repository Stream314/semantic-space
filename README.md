The reason why i started is project is that i would like to quantify every words of any languages,However i am Chinese,so it is much easier for me to establish a Chinese words semantic space
And it is obviously that languages are just words been connected by some law(grammar),personally,i believe everything can be quantify,and i enjoy the process during quantify everything that we can feel.
I would like to calculates feeling or emotions,in Sept 21 2025, so far there is not anyone have ability to precessly calculates feelings changed by languages.
I am trying to be the first one.
